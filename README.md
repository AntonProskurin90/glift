Glift
=====

### The Go Lightweight Frontend

Glift is a modern javascript client for the game
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)">Go</a>

Glift is still in beta.  Until Glift is fully out of it's beta period, the API
may change at any point, without warning.  I do plan on using semantic
versioning to guarantee API behavior, but for that to happen, the API needs to
be improved and a couple of significant widgets need improving.  So, if you wish
to use this library, until that point, you're on your own.

In the meanwhile, for examples of Glift in action, see
[GliftGo.com](http://www.gliftgo.com).

### Development

For depgen.py to work, you'll need to:
  - Export a CLOSURE variable pointing to the closure compiler.
    - e.g., `export CLOSURE="java -jar /path/to/closure_compiler.jar"`
