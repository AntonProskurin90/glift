Done - Add base widget
Done - Add stone hovering to the base widget

Smaller Changes.
- Add generic options parsing. (I'm not sure this is necessary)
- Add support for numbering on the edges, beyond the lines. (Not sure if this is necessary)
- Add tests for widgets.
- Add tests for marks.
- Finish key-stroke mappings -- add more keys, support two go boards on same screen.
- Add movetree->SGF transformation
- Make the comment box prettier. (actionable?)
- Make the adding/removing stones smarter / more efficient.
- Change variation coloring so that it colors existing marks, rather than
  overwriting them.
- Add theme option for how variation numbers should be displayed (i.e., the
  color);
- Make it possible to change the width of the go board border
- Borders seem to not be included as part of 'width', so lining up the comment
  box has problems when the go board does/doesn't have a line-border

- Make Sure KOGOs works (yikes)
  -> depends on adding Poss support

- For problems, support refreshing.  This means storing the old problem
  separately from what's currently being used.

- Create game editor widget. (many dependencies)
  - add moveTree support for delete
  - support vertically centered icons (editor).
  - Add icons for game editor.
  - Add a game editor
  - Support pass.  Currently the parsers barf on B[] and W[]

- Add an info panel (maybe).
- Add the ability to create static images.

Some ideas for future development:
2. Make the base configuration totally resizeable.  This is a relatively
difficult problem I'm not sure what the best way to approach it is.  Probably I
will create a wrapper abstraction that automatically changes the dimensions of
the boxes, since everything is absolutely positioned.  How does the real world
solve this problem?
  - Auto-resizes.
  - Changes orientations based on screen dimensions.  See the KGS window.
4. Make a Problem Reviewer Widget.  Perhaps, generally, make an Info panel box.
