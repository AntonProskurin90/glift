GN[Lee-Sedol-vs-Gu-Li-20140126]PW[Gu Li]PB[Lee Sedol]WR[9d]BR[9d]DT[2014-01-26]EV[MLily Gu vs Lee Jubango]RO[Game 1]PC[Beijing, China]SO[http://gogameguru.com/]AN[An Younggil 8p]C[This was the first game of the MLily Gu vs Lee Jubango, played between Gu Li 9p and Lee Sedol 9p on January 26, 2014.

This event will almost certainly be the most popular and exciting match of 2014.

These two players have been the top two in the world over the last 10 years, and their head to head record before the match stood at 17-1-16 in Gu Li's favor (with one draw).

Among those 34 official games, there have already been many exciting and spectacular contests between these two players.

Even though they both lost in the finals of international tournaments in 2013, They both took domestic titles just before starting this match in 2014.

Internationally, in 2013, Gu Li was defeated by Mi Yuting 9p in the 1st MLily Cup final and Lee Sedol was defeated by Chen Yaoye 9p and Tang Weixing 9p in the 9th Chunlan Cup and 2013 Samsung Cup finals respectively.

However, in January 2014, in China, Gu Li won the 5th Longxing tournament, defeating Li Zhe 6p in the final. Meanwhile, in Korea, Lee Sedol won the 32nd KBS Cup, defeating Park Junghwan 9p.

It's very hard to guess who will win this jubango, but it's surely a special gift for Go fans to be able to watch these two play a series of high quality games together.

We're working on a Go book about this match. You can think of this commentary as the first draft and we'd greatly appreciate your input into the final book! You can learn more about the book here: http://gogameguru.com/lee-sedol-vs-gu-li-go-book/

;B[qp]
;W[dc]
;B[fq]
;W[dn]LB[cn:A]C[The low enclosure at A is more common than this move, but Gu Li likes to answer here because his style emphasizes thickness and fighting. This move has become more popular again in recent years, in part because Gu Li always answers here.]
(;B[lq]LB[qp:3][fq:5][lq:7]C[Lee chose to play the Micro Chinese Opening, creating a framework at the bottom with 3, 5 and 7.]
;W[eq]C[White kicked Black's stone with 8 because he wanted to make it heavier before attacking it.]
;B[fp]
;W[ip]LB[fp:2][ip:3][eq:1]C[Kicking and pincering with 1-3 is typical of Gu Li's style of play.]
(;B[ci]LB[ce:B][cl:A]C[Lee didn't respond directly to White's invasion and split the left side instead. A and B are miai for Black next.]
(;W[ck]LB[dn:A]C[Extending here is more important for White. That's because White's earlier high move at A 'leaves the door open' with respect the territory in the lower left corner.]
(;B[ce]C[Approaching here was the right move.]
(;W[op]LB[ed:A]C[Reinforcing the top left corner at A is a basic joseki, but it looks slack, so Gu approached here. Gu Li's opening is dynamic and lively!]
(;B[lo]TR[ip][op]C[Black has three groups to look after at the bottom now. Black chose to jump out with the center group because it splits and weakens both White's marked stones. This move also helps Black's other groups at the bottom, indirectly.]
(;W[go]LB[ip:A]TR[fp][fq]C[It's more important for White to attack the marked stones, while also helping his pincer stone at A.]
(;B[qn]LB[op:A]C[The stone at A is still light, and it's hard for Black to swallow this area (and the stone) in one move.]
(;W[jq]TR[fp][fq]C[This move was bold. It intended to induce Black into moving the marked stones out by threatening to capture them on the largest possible scale.]
(;B[en]C[Attaching here was a nice tesuji. Black should escape here, to prevent White from completing a very large territory.]
(;W[dm]C[This was the right answer for White.]
;B[em]TR[fp][fq]C[It may seem a bit too early to move the marked stones out, but there weren't any other good options.]
(;W[gm]TR[em][en][fp][fq]C[Jumping here was a powerful move, which kept the pressure on Black's lower left group. The opening up to here looks better for White, but I couldn't find any questionable moves by Black. All I can say is that Gu Li's intuition for the opening is extraordinary.]
(;B[do]LB[eo:A][fo:B]C[Lee wedged here, to settle the shape and prevent White from cutting at A.]
;W[co]
;B[eo]
(;W[dl]LB[cq:A]C[This is another move that epitomizes Gu Li's style. It's slow, because White will want to spend another move in the corner later to prevent Black A. However, Gu might have thought that this move was best, because it creates more power in the center and helps to attack Black's lower left group more severely.]
;B[fl]
(;W[fr]C[This hane was a mistake.]
(;B[hq]LB[er:B][gr:A]C[Jumping here, and omitting the exchange of A for B, was a brilliant idea which preserved Black's aji in the lower left corner.]
(;W[im]C[Gu looked after his center group with this nice shape, but it was another questionable move.]
;B[cp]LB[hq:A]C[This cut was unexpected, but it was a good followup after A.]
;W[cq]
;B[bp]
(;W[bo]C[It was necessary for White to block here, in order to avoid losing points, but...]
;B[bq]
;W[cr]
(;B[br]C[Pushing here was another unexpectedly good move.]
(;W[bs]C[This was the correct answer, but the result was already good for Black.]
;B[er]C[Cutting here was the beginning of a very nice sequence.]
(;W[es]
;B[gr]
(;W[fs]LB[gs:A]C[Answering here was necessary, but Black can still atari at A in sente at anytime later, and this gave Black a big advantage in later fighting.]
;B[fj]C[At this point, White still had more territory on the board, but Black had accumulated more power.]
(;W[hj]
;B[kl]TR[hj][gm][im][go][ip][jq]C[This move shows Lee Sedol's good sense play in the center. It was suddenly revealed that White's marked stones were weaker than they looked when Black played here.]
;W[qq]
(;B[rq]
;W[ln]LB[hk:A]C[This was Gu Li's counter-attack. Gu didn't retreat, he fought back, and the game became more exciting. With this move, Gu can defend the weakness around A indirectly.]
(;B[mn]LB[kn:A]C[Lee fell back because he didn't think the fight starting with the hane at A would favor Black. When your reading shows that a fight will lead to a bad result, or will become difficult for you, you should look for another path. To paraphrase Sun Zi's 'Art of War', "he who knows when to fight, and when not to, will win."]
;W[lm]
;B[mo]TR[op][qq]C[Black's satisfied to fall back solidly and make White's marked stones weaker.]
;W[di]TR[fj][fl][em][en][do][eo][fp][fq][hq][gr]C[White started his leaning attack against Black's lower left group.]
(;B[jn]C[This was the vital point. Lee didn't forget to look for a counter-punch, even though his other group was already under attack.]
;W[gp]
;B[gq]
;W[gl]
(;B[gk]C[This sort of exchange - pushing into a knight's move without cutting - is normally bad. However, it was inevitable in this situation because Black needed to keep his stones connected.]
;W[hk]
(;B[fi]C[Even though the shape isn't pretty, this was the right way to move out.]
(;W[rr]C[This was a probe, but the timing was wrong.]

;B[hp]

(;B[ho]C[This was another good move.]
(;W[ko]LB[km:A]C[Gu didn't want to connect passively at A, so he haned here, but it lead to unexpected fighting afterwards.]

;B[pq]
(;W[nq]C[This was inevitable, but]

(;B[jf]LB[ig:C][ih:A][ji:B]TR[jf][hh][fi]C[Black capped here. This was a good direction to attack from. With this move, Black can take profit at the top and look after his lower left group while attacking. This move also pushes White towards Black's powerful wall.

;B[ap]LB[me:50][ng:E][il:D][in:C][ap:51][cp:A][qq:B]C[White resigned here.

After Black 251 there will be either a ko or a seki in the bottom left corner. White should resign either way. If White had defended the corner instead of playing at 250, Black would have won by 16 points on the board.

This game was quite interesting and fun to watch, and it was a fitting start to the jubango.

White felt good in the opening, but the game became favorable for Black after he cut at A.

White B was a poorly timed probe, and Lee didn't miss his chance to change the flow of the game with C. Black took the initiative with the attack up to D.

White tried to fight back severely and complicate the game with E, but it seemed to be a bit too late. Lee managed the game very well, and I couldn't find any opportunities for White to win after E.

The games of this match have longer time limits than most tournaments do these days. In these sorts of slower games, it's quite hard to reverse a game once one falls behind. That's because the other player has enough time to think carefully at critical moments and maintain their lead through difficult situations.

Lee Sedol is off to a nice start in the jubango, and let's follow the rest of the match together. Every game will be played on the last Sunday of the month, and I'm happy to be able to watch games between two of the world's best Go players.

I'm also happy to be able to share this interesting game with you, and I hope you'll be able to understand and enjoy this game more with this commentary.

If you have any questions or opinions about the game, or the jubango, please feel free to leave a comment.

Thanks,
